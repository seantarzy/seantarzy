### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sean. I am an avid coder, working with a host of different languages and technologies, specializing in Javascript. As a problem solver, in addition to devoting my time to my projects, you can find me practicing algorithms.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently at a great company called [Alignable](alignable.com), helping build and maintain their website
